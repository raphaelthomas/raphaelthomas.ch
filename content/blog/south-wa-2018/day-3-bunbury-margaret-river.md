crossfit 6:30 am class at CrossFit Bunbury with coach CK. then stayed for some more lifting and another WOD. then brekkie at benesse bunbury. hit the road shortly before midday.

made my way down to the busselton jetty again. walked out. got caught by the storm. dry and back. groceries. back on the road. drive to cape naturaliste with the lighthouse. did a tour, had a coffee. then off to margaret river via route 250. absolutely beautiful drive (although rainy every now and then).

arrived in margaret river. another cozy airbnb. dinner at sting.com.au. then gased up the truck and home for a sleep.
