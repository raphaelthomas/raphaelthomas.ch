slept 9hours straight. pizza for breakfast, then shower and pack up for a daytrip. drive to the harbour, bit of a maze and finally made it to eagle? point / the cut.
no dolphins, but beautiful views and a kangaroo sneaking around.

drive to the wellington dam, pictures at the bottom, guts at the lookout. picnic area and camp ground at ??? point. absolutely wonderful. then coffee and a muffin. onwards to collie. mining museum, tanks and m113 (local RSL).
onwards to stockton lake. absolutely beautiful landscape and deep blue waters (minerals?). coffee and sandwich stop at boyup brook (no country music except for my spotify playlist). then drive to balingup via bridgetown. golden valley tree park. stunningly beautiful. short walk around the pear trail (30 mins). then drive to busselton jetty, nice pictures, sunsetish. drive home to bunbury.

got invited for wine and dinner with kay and jeff. amazing hosts. great conversations over the "roast".
