brekkie for the road from sheldon lunch box. drive out to the NP (with some MMP podcast listening). discovered the most beautiful places (no dolphins in the bays though).

walked from hellfire bay to little hellfire bay. then drove to lucky bay and walked the beach to the other and and back. then off to frenchman's peak and climbing the top.

back to esperance adn dinner at loose goose followed by daily car maintenance (cleaning windows & refuelling).
