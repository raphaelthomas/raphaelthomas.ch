early rise, car pick up, bit of a pain, drop in at crossfit frantic
wonderful place, tips for the road, shopping intermezzo, food. hit the road
country music and rock anthems down to dwellingup, brief stop. all the way to
bunbury with a brief stop in harvey.

checkin at the airbnb with key and jeff. perfect hosts, great welcome. walk
through town: found the dolphin discovery centre closed. back to the light hosue and
lookout tower. then to italian food (take away pizze b/c too many antipasti).
bottle of wine instead of a glass. oops. back home and sleep, really tired
(short sleep, cf, time difference).
