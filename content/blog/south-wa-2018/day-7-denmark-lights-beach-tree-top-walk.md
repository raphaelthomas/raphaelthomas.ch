slept a lot. brekkie from margaret river leftovers. hit the road for the beaches. absolutely beautiful lights beach (even with a rainbow).

drove to tree top walk. 40m above ground is pretty damn high. survived though.

more beaches, stunning green pools and elephant rocks. full rainbow over the road on the way back to denmark.

delicious pizza for dinner.
